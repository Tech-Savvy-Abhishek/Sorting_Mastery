## Project Highlights

- **Strategy Design Pattern:** The project leverages the Strategy Pattern, encapsulating sorting algorithms within distinct classes that inherit from the SortStrategy base class. This design fosters flexibility, allowing dynamic strategy selection at runtime.

- **Comprehensive Sorting Algorithms:** Sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort are meticulously implemented, providing a comprehensive view of different sorting strategies.

- **Benchmarking Excellence:** Through a benchmarking approach, the project meticulously measures and compares the average execution time of each sorting algorithm. The results offer insights into the efficiency of these strategies for real-world applications.
